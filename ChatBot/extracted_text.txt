As
India’s
leadingmanufactur er
of
modern
building
solutions,
Magicrete
has
touched
the
lives
of
millions.
It
is
a
matter
of
great
pride
for
us
as
we
strive
to
make
the
world
greener
and
more
vibrant.
Reducing
the
environmental
impact
of
construction
activity
is
the
need
of
the
hour.
As
habitats
are
destroyed
to
make
way
for
towns
and
cities,
the
lines
between
development
and
sustainability
have
been
blurred.
Over
the
years,
our
employees
have
been
ambassadors
at
large
when
it
comes
to
honoring
and
co-existing
with
Mother
Nature.
It
is
one
of
the
core
reasons
for
us
to
constantly
innovate
and
bring
greater
value
to
our
customers.
Corporate
Social
Responsibility
is
deeply
ingrained
in
every
member
of
our
team.
Our
vision
is
to
help
build
sustainable
communities.F rom
tree
plantation
drives
to
spreading
awareness
about
the
environment
through
street
plays,
our
team
has
been
consistently
working
towards
a
greener
future
for
generations
to
come.
Planting
saplings
by
new
hires
as
well
as
visitors
is
a
practice
that
we
are
proud
of.
Change,
after
all,
begins
with
awareness.
To
dispel
ignorance
and
improve
a
lot
of
economically
backward
sections
of
society,
education
is
vital.
To
quote
the
United
Nations,
education
is
the
‘universal
passport
to
human
development’.T o
equip
the
children
of
daily
wage
workers
and
laborers
with
basic
literacy
skills,
Magicrete
launched
its
‘Pathshala’
initiative
in
Aug
2018.
A
part
of
our
CSR
mission,
Education
Above
All,
our
Navsari
unit
is
supporting
an
initiative
to
teach
young
children
to
read
and
write.In
addition,
they
are
also
given
basic
health,
hygiene,
and
nutrition
training.
The
results
have
been
encouraging.
At
an
Independence
Day
event
organized
by
Magicrete,
some
of
these
children
participated
in
a
short
skit
about
India’s
freedom
struggle
with
over
100
people
in
attendance.
They
also
sang
the
National
Anthem
with
aplomb.
Their
appearance
and
manners
have
also
changed
for
the
better.Since
2008,
Magicrete
has
introduced
innovative
new
construction
methods
in
the
country.
With
initiatives
like
Pathshala,
we
aim
to
let
change
percolate
to
the
very
roots
of
our
society.
With
the
seed
of
knowledge
sown,
we
are
conﬁdent
that
the
future
will
be
even
brighter
than
the
present.

EnvironmentMagicr ete
is
one
of
India’s
pioneering
sustainability
champions
with
the
aim
of
replacing
clay
bricks
that
cause
denudation
to
the
cultivable
soil
with
Aerated
autoclaved
concrete
blocks
that
recycle
ﬂy-ash,
a
waste
generated
in
steel
furnaces.
There
are
several
reasons
why
AAC
blocks
are
beneﬁcial
for
the
environment.
Right
through
the
production
of
AAC,
to
their
transport,
to
the
construction
of
AAC-based
structures
and
ﬁnally
in
the
maintenance
of
AAC
structure
buildings,
they
contribute
signiﬁcantly
to
sustainability
and
reduction
of
carbon
footprints.Pr oduction:The
key
raw
material
for
AAC
manufacturing
is
ﬂy-ash,
which
is
a
waste
from
steel
manufacturing.
On
the
other
hand,
clay
brick
manufacturing
uses
cultivable
soil
reducing
forest
area.
The
production
process
itself
requires
at
least
30%
less
energy
compared
to
clay
brick
manufacturing
and
hence
contributes
directly
to
better
carbon
emission
foot
prints.Transportation:AA C
bricks
are
signiﬁcantly
lighter
than
clay
bricks
for
the
same
volume.
Hence
the
cost
of
transporting
these
bricks
to
the
construction
spot
is
much
lower
yielding
to
savings
in
logistics
cost.
Also,
light
weight
makes
it
more
energy-eﬃcient
for
the
blocks
to
be
transported
to
higher
levels,
leading
to
additional
savings.Water

AAC
Blocks,
MagicPlast
and
MagicBond
are
eco-friendly
substitutes
to
clay
bricks,
plaster
and
cement
joints
respectively
because
they
need
very
little
water
in
the
construction
process.
Since
there
are
fewer
joints
in
the
AAC-related
construction,
and
MagicPlast
doesn’t
need
more
than
24
hours
of
curing
time,
the
water
requirement
is
substantially
reduced.
In
places
like
Gurgaon,
where
high
court
has
forbidden
usage
of
ground
water
for
construction
activities,
AAC
can
reduce
water
consumption
signiﬁcantly .Maintenance
of
AAC
structures:AAC
structures
have
a
very
high
thermal
insulation
index
which
means
that
the
ambient
temperature
within
these
structures
doesn’t
change
rapidly
with
the
external
temperature.
Hence
these
structure
remain
relatively
cooler
in
summers
and
warmer
in
winters
–
reducing
the
HVAC
bill
and
heat
requirements.
Hence,
AAC
structures
are
recommended
for
a
variety
of
structures
including
malls,
high-rise,
oﬃce
complexes,
schools,
hospitals,
stand-alone
homes
etc.

Our

Certiﬁcation!
Our

to
work
has
now
got
an
oﬃcial
endorsement
from
the
Great

Work
institute.
We
are
proud
of
our
people,
culture,
and
work
environment.
This
third-party
validation
is
a
testament
to
our
efforts
and
conﬁrmation
from
our
top
talent

larger-than-lif e
celebrations
of

Festivals
help
break
the
monotony
of
life
and
are
the
carriers
of
peace
and
joy
in
our
community .
Furthermore,
they
allow
us
to
celebrate
life's

We
at
Magicrete
believe
in
enjoying
time
with
colleagues
in
a
relaxed
and
fun
environment
to
encourage
honest
and
open
discussion
and
trust
in
one
another.If
employees
are
friends
with
the
people,
they
work
with,
rather
than
simply
being
colleagues,
they''ll
work
better
together
and
communicate
more
effectively.
In
addition
to
various
fun-ﬁlled
activities
at
work
like
drama,
dumb
charades,
movie
watching,
and
team
games,
we
also
have
regular
outings
at
multiple
locations
in
India.
For
example,
in
2022,
we
took
our
employees
to
Rishikesh.
We
have
also
gone
to
Daman,
Lonavala,
and
other
places
for
strategic
meets
and
company
growth
plan
discussions
and
enjoy

with
colleagues.
The

call
for
celebration.
At
the

Annual
Sports
Competitions
We
at
magicrete
give
credence
to
the
fact
that
sports
are
indispensable
for
an
individual' s
physical
and
mental
development.
Therefore,
we
organize
annual
sports
competitions
for
games
like
cricket,
chess,
table
tennis,
caroms,
etc.
This
annual
sports
event
empowers
our
employees
to
pursue
and
partake
in
sports
events
they
are
perfervid
about.
Employees
from
divergent
cultures
and
locations
in
India
foregather
at
a
speciﬁc
place
to
exchange
their
cultural
ideas.
They
also
compete
against
each
other
in
numerous
sports
activities
of
their
choice.
We
also
make
sports
events
enjoyable
by
adding
a
few
compelling
pre-events
before
the
main
event.
For
example,
cricket
is
a
notable
event
in
our
annual
sports
meet.
Therefore,
to
make
this
event
more
exhilarating,
we
conduct
auctions
so
that
team
leaders
can
select
their
teams.
In
addition,
food,
medical
aid,
and
sports
referees
are
made
accessible
for
all
the
players
for
the
whole
day,
along
with
other
entertainment
forms
like
music.
The
sports
day
culminates
with
accolades
and
laurels
to
exponents
from
individual
sports
and
thanking
testimonies
to
the
organizing
team.
Employee

Our

and
we
ensure
that
they

FAQs
Is
tile
adhesive
waterproof?One
can
now
ﬁnd
several
tile
adhesives
in
the
market.
These
serve
different
purposes
apt
for
your
area
of
application.
There
are
many
tile
adhesives
that
we
can
now
use
in
areas
subjected
to
constant
contact
with
water
freely
without
much
worry.
The
use
of
such
tile
adhesives
holds
ﬁrm
against
continuous
water
exposure.
Check
the
adhesive
package
to
ﬁnd
whether
it
is
waterproof
or
not.What
material
are
you
using
for
tile
on
tile
ﬁtting?For
tile
on
tile
ﬁtting,
make
sure
that
the
original
tiles
should
be
excellent
in
condition
and
free
from
cracks.
Before
tiling
on
tile
application,
you
should
ensure
that
the
existing
surface
is
on
a
level
to
avoid
gaps
in
the
future.
The
steps
involve
cleaning
the
previously
tiled
surface
with
the
help
of
sandpaper .
Making
the
existing
surface
rough
allows
the
new
tiles
to
adhere
correctly.
To
provide
an
even
foundation
to
the
new
tiles,
apply
a
thin
ﬁlm
of
thin-set
mortar.
After
that,
let
the
coat
dry
appropriately
for
at
least
24
hours.

FAQs
Epoxy
Grouts
Why
do
you
need
grout?Once
you
complete
your
tile
installation
procedure,
you
get
to
notice
some
spaces
left
in
between
the
tiles.
We
need
grouts
to
ﬁll
those
spaces.
Hence,
grout
acts
as
a
joint
ﬁller
which
increases
the
life
span
of
the
tiles.
In
addition,
by
grouting
the
tiles,
you
leave
no
room
for
the
debris
or
water
to
enter
in
between
or
under
your
tile.
We,
therefore,
need
grout
to
add
strength
and
rigidity
to
your
tiles.What
is
grouting
in
a
bathroom?We
all
know
bathroom
areas
are
often
prone
to
continuous
water
exposure.
The
heavy
moisture
from
the
steam
and
condensation
may
be
problematic
for
the
grouts.
Avoid
using
cement-based
grouts
in
the
bathroom.
The
porous
nature
of
cement
grouts
may
lead
to
the
breakdown
of
the
grout
itself.
Cement-based
grouts
give
rise
to
fungi
and
mold
growth
in
moisture-subjected
areas.
We
instead
advise
you
to
use
epoxy
grouts
which
are
water-resistant
and
the
best
choice
for
the
bathroom.How
is
grouting
done?Following
are
the
essential
steps
to
tile
grouting.
•
It
is
vital
to
choose
the
suitable
grout
for
your
area
of
application.
Improper
grouting
may
worsen
the
situation.
•
Mix
the
grout
with
the
required
quantity
of
water
as
instructed
by
the
manufactur er.
If
you
add
too
much
water,
the
grout
will
lose
its
consistency
and
strength.
•
Apply
the
grout
at
an
angle
of
45
◦
with
the
help
of
a
grout
ﬂoat.
•
Wipe
the
excess
grout
with
a
damp
sponge.Is
grout
waterproof?If
you
do
not
choose
an
appropriate
grout
suitable
for
your
area
or
carry
out
improper
grouting,
you
may
start
noticing
cracks
in
your
grouts,
allowing
the
water
to
seep
through.
To
grout
water-prone
areas,
we
recommend
you
use
epoxy-based
grouts.
Epoxy
grouts
are
waterproof,
which
makes
them
non-porous.
It
also
has
high
bonding
strength
and
won’t
crack,
stain,
or
shrink
upon
the
action
of
water.What
happens
if
I
don’t
seal
grout?We
advise
you
to
seal
your
grouts
permanently ,
especially
in
moisture-prone
areas.
If
you
do
not
do
so
in
time,
the
grout
will
absorb
bacteria,
water,
and
stains.
The
entry
of
the
grime
and
water
may
develop
cracks
in
your
tiles.
These
cracks
can
further
cause
the
complete
breakdown
of
your
tiles
at
a
certain
point.
When
you
seal
your
grout,
you
extend
the
lifespan
of
the
tiles,
which
causes
minimum
damage
to
your
tiling
area.Which
type
of
grouts
doesn’t
need
sealer?The
only
kind
of
grout
that
doesn’t
require
sealing
is
epoxy
grout.
The
sole
reason
is
the
already
inherent
sealers
within
them.
In
addition,
epoxy
grouts
are
tough
and
non-porous
in
nature.
Therefore,
you
can
skip
sealers
when
dealing
with
epoxy
grouts.Do
grout
sealers
work?Sealing
the
grouts
is
a
wiser
step
to
increase
the
bonding
power
of
your
tiles.
However,
you
can't
go
for
one
kind
of
grout
for
every
situation.
We
advise
you
to
choose
your
grout
sealers
according
to
your
tiling
requirements
and
location.
If
you
carry
out
the
grout
sealing
with
proper
care,
it
will
take
care
of
your
grout
from
cracking
or
water
attacks.Should
I
seal
unsanded
grout?Unsanded
grouts
don't
contain
sand
and
ﬁnd
application
in
thin
grout
lines.
You
can
use
them
for
delicate
tile
surfaces.
It
isn't
always
necessar y
to
carry
out
sealing
in
some
applications
of
the
unsanded
grouts.
However,
we
still
recommend
packing
your
unsanded
grout
with
a
penetrating
sealer
to
provide
excellent
protection.What
is
tile
epoxy?Epoxy
grout
used
for
tiles
is
the
best
choice
for
grouting
your
tiles
when
the
areas
come
under
continuous
water
action.
Epoxy
grouts
are
chemical
resistant
and
non-porous.
The
non-porous
nature
keeps
away
bacterial
or
mildew
growth.
Hence,
making
them
highly
apt
for
water-prone
areas
such
as
bathrooms
or
kitchens.
In
addition,
epoxy
grouts
help
your
tiles
to
perform
well
and
stay
durable
for
a
long
time.Can
I
use
epoxy
on
tiles?It
would
be
best
if
you
used
epoxy
on
tiles
when
the
tiling
is
susceptible
to
the
continuous
ﬂow
of
water.
The
water
ingress
can
lead
to
the
breakdown
of
your
tiles.
Cracks
at
speciﬁc
points
due
to
this
water
attack
can
prove
to
be
detrimental.
When
you
use
epoxy
on
tiles
properly,
you
are
making
sure
that
you
prolong
the
lifespan
of
your
tiles.
It
would
help
if
you
used
epoxy
grout
on
tiles
when
affected
by
chemical
and
water
attacks.Can
you
epoxy
over
tile
and
grout?Yes,
you
can
lay
epoxy
over
your
tiles
and
existing
cement
grout.
All
you
need
is
to
do
the
task
appropriately
with
the
use
of
the
correct
tools.
Without
any
hassle,
the
use
of
epoxy
grout
will
enhance
the
look
of
your
old
tiling.
It
will
also
impart
strength
at
the
same
time.
The
results
will
be
much
more
robust
and
resilient.Is
it
ok
to
put
tiles
on
top
of
tiles?You
can
create
a
new
tiling
surface
on
the
existing
one.
All
you
need
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
the
surface
of
the
old
tiles
should
be
free
from
any
cracks
or
unevenness.
It
would
help
if
you
leveled
the
existing
subsurface
with
proper
grouting.
Keep
a
check
that
there
is
no
presence
of
mold
or
mildew.
You
can
go
for
an
excellent
tile
adhesive
reliable
enough
to
avoid
any
hindrances
while
tile
on
tile
application.
By
doing
so,
you
will
create
a
smooth
surface
for
the
new
layer
of
tiles.Should
you
remove
old
tiles
before
tiling?Undoubtedly
the
tile
on
tile
applications
keeps
you
away
from
the
hassle
of
lifting
the
old
tiles.
But,
it
is
advisable
as
long
as
your
existing
surfaces
have
no
hollowness
and
is
relatively
sound.
Sometimes
the
old
tiles
are
susceptible
to
mold
and
mildew
attacks
and
with
inappropriate
leveling.
Tile
laying
on
the
old
tiles
then
may
become
problematic
for
the
new
layer
of
tiles.
Check
for
such
problems
in
your
old
tiles.
If
existing,
you
will
need
to
prep
the
old
surface
with
lots
of
effort.
In
that
case,
the
best
thing
to
do
is
get
rid
of
the
tile
and
thin-set.How
to
tile
on
top
of
tiles?Choosing
a
suitable
adhesive
is
a
signiﬁcant
step
before
laying
newtiles
on
top
of
old
tiles.
First,
see
to
it
if
the
old
surface
is
in
level.
If
not,
level
out
the
accumulated
dried
grout
with
the
help
of
a
sander.
Next,
use
suitable
tile
adhesives
to
secure
any
loose
tiles
so
that
the
new
surface
would
be
smooth
enough
for
the
new
tile
installation.
Once
you
adequately
do
the
surface
prep,
you
can
tile
on
top
of
tiles
as
you
tile
any
surface.
Next,
cover
the
new
tiles
with
the
appropriate
adhesives
over
their
backside
and
the
subsurface.
Continue
until
you
have
evenly
tiled
on
top
of
the
old
tiles.
Afterward,
grout
the
new
tiles
too,
and
you
are
good
to
go.Can
you
epoxy
over
kitchen
tile?Using
epoxy
grouts
for
your
kitchen
is
a
wise
choice.
Now
you
will
ask
us
why.
The
sole
reason
is
that
it
is
highly
durable,
stain
and
chemical
resistant,
and
suitably
rigid
to
make
it
apt
for
kitchen
application.
It
makes
your
kitchen
countertop
eﬃciently
stronger.
The
epoxy
grouts
stand
out
in
the
crowd
when
areas
susceptible
to
greases
and
water-prone
damage
need
grouting.
Your
kitchen
needs
proper
cleaning
when
you
accidentally
spill
your
favorite
dish
on
the
ﬂoor.
With
epoxy
grout,
cleaning
becomes
more
accessible.
You
now
don't
need
to
worry
about
the
maintenance
of
your
kitchen.

the
four
steps
to
waterprooﬁng?It
is
crucial
to
carry
out
the
waterprooﬁng
of
your
structure
in
a
proper
way.
The
four
most
essential
steps
to
waterprooﬁng
are:
1.
Clean
and
smooth
the
substrate.
2.
Preparation
of
the
sub-surface
is
necessar y.
3.
Apply
the
primer.
4.
Apply
the
waterprooﬁng
membrane.What
is
waterprooﬁng
roof?When
you
live
in
an
area
where
you
have
to
face
frequent
rainstorms,
your
roof
suffers
huge
problems.
Therefore,
it
is
essential
to
provide
extra
protection
to
your
rooftop
by
waterprooﬁng
it.
When
you
use
waterprooﬁng
material
for
your
roof,
you
prevent
roof
leaks.
In
addition,
by
waterprooﬁng
your
roof,
you
control
the
damage
to
your
walls
or
support
beams
from
rotting
due
to
water
attacks.
Magicrete
suggests
you
go
for
MagicShield-
RoofPRO
Advanced
so
that
your
roof
is
robust
and
water-tight.How
long
should
waterprooﬁng
last?When
you
choose
the
quality
waterprooﬁng
for
your
structure,
you
ensure
that
it
will
last
you
for
no
less
than
ten
years.
But
at
the
same
time,
when
you
opt
for
faulty
waterprooﬁng,
your
structure
will
have
to
suffer
in
the
future.
Therefore,
we
advise
you
to
avoid
poor
workmanship
and
poor
quality
waterprooﬁng
product.
Instead,
we
recommend
you
choose
from
Magicrete's
wide
range
of
waterprooﬁng
products
that
will
last
you
much
longer.What
is
a
bituminous
sheet?Bitumen
sheet
is
the
well-known
and
most
suitable
waterprooﬁng
material
for
your
structure.
These
sheets
are
hydrophobic
in
nature.
When
you
install
bitumen
sheets,
you
make
sure
that
no
water
enters
your
building.
It
ﬁnds
its
use
as
a
shield
for
your
rooﬁng
against
the
water
attack.
These
membranes
also
serve
as
water
repellents
for
basements,
bridges,
and
other
structures.How
do
I
waterproof
my
walls?It
is
essential
to
waterproof
your
walls
to
keep
away
the
water
problems.
Choose
a
rich
quality
waterprooﬁng
product
for
your
walls.
Before
waterprooﬁng
your
walls,
you
will
need
to
remove
the
existing
putty.
Next,
smooth
out
the
subsurface
with
a
metal
brush.
Next,
we
advise
you
to
apply
at
least
two
coats
of
the
selected
waterprooﬁng
solution.
This
application
will
create
a
thick
layer
that
will
cover
all
the
cracks
in
the
wall.
In
addition,
it
will
also
protect
your
wall
from
mold
or
mildew
growth.
After
waterprooﬁng
your
wall,
apply
a
layer
of
putty,
a
primer,
and
go
with
the
two
coats
of
your
selected
waterprooﬁng
paint.
We
suggest
you
use
Magicrete’s
innovative
WallPRO
Waterprooﬁng
solution
for
your
walls.Which
cement
is
best
for
waterprooﬁng?The
best
cement
for
waterprooﬁng
is
water
repellent
cement.
The
hydrophobic
concrete
consists
of
Portland
cement
with
the
best
additives.
This
water
repellent
cement
gives
more
strength
to
your
structure
by
acting
as
a
protective
waterprooﬁng
shield.
The
use
of
waterprooﬁng
cement
will
not
give
way
to
water
seepage.
